## 1. Programming Fundamentals
Start by mastering a scripting or programming language widely used in automation:
- **Python** (highly recommended)
- **Bash/Shell scripting**
- **PowerShell** (for Windows environments)
- **JavaScript** (for frontend/backend automation)

**Key Concepts:**  
- Variables, loops, conditionals  
- Functions and modules  
- File handling and regex  
- Exception handling

---

## 2. Scripting & Automation Basics
- Automate daily repetitive tasks (file backups, data parsing)  
- Use cron jobs (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for scheduling  
- Learn to interact with APIs (REST/HTTP requests) via scripts  
- Use automation libraries:  
  - Python: `requests`, `selenium`, `pyautogui`  
  - JavaScript: `puppeteer`, `axios`

---

## 3. Version Control
- Git basics: init, clone, branch, commit, merge, push, pull  
- Use GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for remote repositories  
- Write clean commit messages and use branching strategies (Gitflow, trunk-based)  

---

## 4. CI/CD Automation
- Understand Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment concepts  
- Tools to learn:  
  - **Jenkins**  
  - **GitHub Actions**  
  - **GitLab CI**  
  - **CircleCI**  
- Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines  
- Integrate automated tests and code quality checks  

---

## 5. Infrastructure Automation
- Learn **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** concepts  
- Tools:  
  - **Terraform** â€“ Cloud resource provisioning  
  - **AWS CloudFormation**  
  - **Azure ARM Templates**  
- Automate environment setup and teardown  
- Use CLI tools (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud)

---

## 6. Automated Testing
- Types of testing: Unit, Integration, Functional, E2E, Load  
- Test Automation Frameworks:  
  - Python: `pytest`, `unittest`  
  - JavaScript: `Jest`, `Mocha`, `Cypress`  
  - Selenium WebDriver (multi-language support)  
- Use Behavior Driven Development (BDD) tools:  
  - Cucumber, Behave  
- Automate UI, API, and mobile testing  

---

## 7. Containerization & Orchestration
- Understand Docker fundamentals: images, containers, volumes, networking  
- Write Dockerfiles to containerize applications  
- Use **Docker Compose** for multi-container setups  
- Learn Kubernetes basics: pods, deployments, services  
- Use Helm charts for Kubernetes app management  

---

## 8. Monitoring & Logging
- Setup automated alerts and dashboards  
- Tools to learn:  
  - **Prometheus** (metrics collection)  
  - **Grafana** (visualization)  
  - **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging  
- Integrate monitoring into automation pipelines  

---

## 9. Cloud Automation
- Learn major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP  
- Automate cloud resources with CLI and SDKs  
- Use serverless technologies: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions  
- Automate deployments using Terraform + CI/CD  

---

## 10. Configuration Management
- Automate system configuration and software deployment  
- Tools:  
  - **Ansible** (agentless, YAML-based)  
  - **Puppet**  
  - **Chef**  
  - **SaltStack**  
- Write playbooks/manifests to maintain desired state  

---

## 11. DevOps Culture & Practices
- Understand Agile and DevOps principles  
- Continuous Feedback and Collaboration  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Automation first mindset  
- Use of chatops and incident management automation  

---

## 12. Additional Tools & Skills
- API Automation & Testing (Postman, REST Assured)  
- Security automation basics (vulnerability scanning, secrets management)  
- Scripting for cloud SDKs (boto3 for AWS, Azure SDK)  
- Learning YAML and JSON for config files  
- Basic Networking knowledge  

---

## 13. Real-World Projects
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for a web app with testing and deployment  
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform + Ansible  
- End-to-end testing automation with Selenium or Cypress  
- Containerizing and deploying multi-service app on Kubernetes  
- Monitoring setup with Prometheus + Grafana for a sample app
